""" Consider the function swap_min_max(L) that exchanges the positions of (in other
words, swaps) the maximal and the minimal numbers in a list L of integers. It re-
turns the result as a new list. If there are several numbers equal to the maximum, or
several numbers equal to the minimum, or both, swap the the last number equal to the
maximum with the last number equal to the minimum. You may assume that L has at
least two distinct numbers.
Write a pytest program for swap_min_max with five test cases. Diversity of the tests is
important in marking. """
